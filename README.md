# Basic, from-scratch pancakes

Pancakes are great, but you're tired of buying pre-made mixes from the store. Guess what, you don't have to. These pancakes are simple, and rely on easy-to-find ingredients. You can even mix the dry ingredients ahead of time for travel or camping.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon white sugar
* 1 1/4 cups milk 
* 1 egg 
* 3 tablespoons butter, melted

## Directions

1. Mix dry ingredients thoroughly. 
2. Add wet ingredients and mix until smooth. Thin with more milk or water to make more pancakes. 
3. Add a bit of oil or butter to a medium hot pan. Once the surface is covered, add a ladel-full of batter.
4. Cook until the top appears drier around the edges, flip over.
5. Store done pancakes on a cookie sheet in a 250F oven until it's time to eat.

## Variations

### Buttermilk pancakes

Use buttermilk instead of milk when mixing, or add 4 tablespoons of buttermilk powder to dry ingredients.

### Fluffier pancakes

Add a small amount of vinegar, or better, sour cream when mixing. The acid helps to react with the baking powder making the pancakes fluffier.

### Fruit and spices

Add blueberries, fruit, cinnemon, or other spices to taste. For fruit pancakes, reduce the amount of milk added slightly. This will make the pancake batter thicker, and keep the fruit "inside" the pancake while cooking.
